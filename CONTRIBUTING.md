# Contributing

Thank you for your interest in this project!

At this time, I am not accepting contributions, or pull requests. While I truly
appreciate the enthusiasm for this project, it is currently being maintained
privately and on a limited schedule.

If you are experiencing delays in updates or addressing of reported issues, feel
free to fork the repository and make any changes you need. You're welcome to
adapt the code to suit your use case.

If you want to publish the fork, my only request is that you change the name to
avoid confusing prior followers of the project.

Thanks for your understanding!
