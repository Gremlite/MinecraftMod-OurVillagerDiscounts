# Our Villager Discounts

#### A Minecraft mod for sharing villager discounts across players

The earliest supported version of Minecraft is 1.16.2.

### Why?

This should simply be a datapack, but there is an [open
issue](https://bugs.mojang.com/browse/MC-153392) as of 1.14.2 concerning the
deletion and modification of villager NBT data. As this data can't be changed
through commands, I've opted to make this mod in the meanwhile.

### Launcher support

This project supports the
[Fabric](https://github.com/Gremlite/MinecraftMod-OurVillagerDiscounts/tree/fabric)
and
[Forge](https://github.com/Gremlite/MinecraftMod-OurVillagerDiscounts/tree/forge)
launchers. Support for each launcher is managed on its own branch.

#### Fabric

Fabric has a dependency on the
[Fabric API](https://www.curseforge.com/minecraft/mc-mods/fabric-api) and
[Fabric Language Kotlin](https://www.curseforge.com/minecraft/mc-mods/fabric-language-kotlin)
mods to run successfully.
